About The Theme (Feeder Weeder) - 
This theme is the part of Track 3: Swarm Robotics. This Theme involves multiple robots cooperating to fertilize the plants and remove the weeds in a farm. Two robots carrying different fertilizers and one robot whose primary function is to remove weeds traverse an arena representing a farm. Each Fertilizer Robot identifies and fertilizes the crop that requires the fertilizer that it is carrying; the Weeding Robot identifies and removes weeds from the field. The challenge is to collaborate and complete the fertilization and de-weeding in the most efficient manner.
